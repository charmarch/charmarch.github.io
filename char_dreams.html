        <p>Solar notes in the one I spilled that the assistant guy who was an expert was showing me and I immediately jumped to cleaning it up and he was like it would do you good to be more embarrassed and I didn’t understand cuz how is it more polite to stand around being useless and embarrassed than to start fixing things. Also it was initially like relatives in france gathering and me trying on diff fragrances to figure out which to wear to French consulate (in France which makes no fucking sense) and I went lighter I think but then a little girl who was there had some health issues so we had to revamp the colour theme to be more somber and appropriate so I was selecting a fragrance. Layered from the garden and bois de balincourt and then spilled the one on me. Also at some point [UNCLE] as I was applying bois de balincourt was like that smells cool you should spray it on this piece of cardboard so that you can take it with you to Montreal and I was like WHY would I do that</p>

        <p>Omg I dreamt that we were somewhere like a grocery store/market around dinner time and were trying to figure out what to cook and saw like a dozen dead rats on the floor so I was like oh this could be nice! And was prepping one but then there was one who wasn’t dead yet so I had to behead it and then when all the rats were ready I suddenly realized that maybe we shouldn’t be eating dead rats from the floor of a grocery store so we found a cob of corn and cooked that instead…</p>

        <p>I dreamt that you and I were walking a chicken that when it was on leash it looked like a golden doodle puppy or something like that but wen it was off leash it went back to chicken mode and I was begging u to tell me the name of this instagram famous chicken so I could send a reel to my friend like omg look who I’m walking right now but u refused bc u already sent me the name of the chicken and I didn’t care enough then to remember now </p>

        <p>I dreamt we were hanging out on a grassy hill that led right to water and I was like we need to go before the huge almost tsunami comes and you were like what it’s so sunny and perfect and still and i was like no it’s coming and sure enough the water rose up to form these massive waves that came to shore fast so we started swimming away and before it started I had already posted an Instagram story warning people so there were a lot of people also swimming away but we were like avoiding the worst of it by riding the waves and spinning like we would go upside down it was a rlly funny dream especially bc the last thing before I woke up was you me a couple other people we know treading water in a calm zone and someone we knew had linked up w like 12 year old millie bobby brown and then a second millie bobby brown appeared behind her and she said guys this is my friend Flowers and I laughed so hard in the dream that I laughed irl</p>

        <p>Last night I dreamt I used [BOY]’s pencil sharpener to sharpen my lip liner which I think is a message that I need to buy a better sharpener for it bc my pencil sharpener always makes it uneven and it's such a waste</p>

        <p>Omg I dreamt that I went to like some kids adventure park thingie it was kind of the vibe of the play things at McDonald’s but bigger less crawling more walking and also animals at various zones in it including a part at the bottom that opened up into a literal lake or ocean and me and my friends were swimming in the ocean bit and looking at animals and we got out when it was closing time and were climbing back up to another section when I heard a rattle and was like GUYS THERE IS A SNAKE!!!! so everyone tried to get out of the way but the snake decided to go for ME and BIT ME except it only managed to puncture me with one of its teeth like it looked kind of stupid a snake bite with one wound anyway I freaked the fuck out cuz rattlesnakes are like venomous so I found an employee and I was like um excuse me I think I have a rattlesnake bite is there anything you could do to make sure I don’t die and she was NOT HAVING IT she was so annoyed with me bc it was after closing and she went and found a little snake and was holding it but she never actually said that that’s what bit me so I think it was a mind game to get me to think I had been bitten by that and not a rattlesnake and I was like ok but I literally heard a rattle and she was like That’s not my problem and I was like WHAT? But I didn’t want to be rude to an employee so I was like there for a little while longer just kind of lingering and hoping maybe another employee would confirm it was a rattlesnake bite and help me and eventually she turned to me and was like you’re going to have to talk to someone who doesn’t have a curly necklace about this. and I was like what? And then I looked and saw that she had a curly necklace idk how to describe it but there was the chain and then the charm was like some brand name with the logo printed flat but twisted in a tube to look really garish and 2000s Like just imagine what Calvin Klein would do if they made necklaces with their logo and so I was like omg I loveeee your necklace and she left. and I was like well i would probably be in a lot more pain than I am in if it was a rattlesnake but it’s kind of fucked up that she wouldn’t even tell me if it was the little snake she was holding or not to at least give me peace of mind so I left</p>

        <p>That reminds me that last night I dreamt that [SISTER] brought a horse into my apartment and I was so mad at her for it and she was like what’s wrong with the horse and I was like where do you think the horse is going to shit. Get the horse out. And the entire dream was her trying to get the horse out before it shit on the floor</p>

        <p>Oh my god i had the scariest dream it was like the hunger games and first it was people we know including us competing and then the games ended but I don’t think that many people actually died but then we like went back home and this time people from the capitol like just random citizens moved there too and it was so strange like basically extreme violence naturally arose with the capitol and non capitol people
        So we’d be chilling and then people would set off bombs and stuff. And we were obviously trying not to partake and to live Normal lives and ignoring the fact that there were literally real life murder rampages occurring so we were trying to walk and talk and then huge metal weights were being fired like cannons in all directions and we were on a sidewalk on top of hill and there were two older women below which was on the harbour front boardwalk trying to aim at us and they almost got us but we kept deflecting the weights and then we went down the hill while being chased by these huge cannons and we stole their launcher which turned into a huge syringe filled with red liquid and it was us or them like they wouldn’t let us live so I plunged the syringe into one of the womens skulls and her head came off and I put the liquid in and she died like that with her head like almost exploding while the other woman watched and cried and was like how could you even tho THEY were literally trying to kill US and then it struck me that I had murdered someone and via massive syringe no less so I ran along the boardwalk screaming and crying about how I had killed someone while you chased me and then I woke up!!! The hunger games part was interesting while the games were happening and we were training in the capitol [GIRL FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL] had snuck out at night and gotten drunk with a bunch of capitol kids and she returned after the end of the games while we were waiting on the capitol for the capitol ppl to like kill the rest of us and she was like they’re not so different except we thought that meant that she was crazy if she could get along with these naturally violent ppl but idek if the capitol ppl were naturally violent bc the ones she hung out w were her age and she obviously didn’t die. But then she did die or was killed by the adult capitol ppl when they rounded us up before the district people and the capitol people merged. Have a good day at work!!!</p>

        <p>I had a dream about gay people using the quadratic formula like [MY GROUPCHAT WITH TWO GAY FRIENDS] was doing the quadratic formula for fun as if it was a game and there was a past where we had to solve a YouTube link like it was a derivative but you had to be well read in gay culture or history for it and I was not so I didn’t finish that part of the game</p>

        <p>It had a WHOLE PLOT but the most I remember it was of the end when this guy was sitting into a chair like strapped in with head metal things attached with wires and there was some sort of stand off where either he or a pig could live so a bunch of scientists were trying to kill the pig first with lots of bows and arrows but the pig could retaliate and blow the whole centre up and that was the climax of the dream and they released all the arrows but at the same time the pig died and it became in the dream unclear who was the good guy, the man in the chair or the pig but I think they were both evil the scientists were just trying to keep the man in the chair alive because he was human and they wanted to study him. Anyway at the moment when in the hospital room there was the man lying in the chair and the pig with some sort of metal contraption tightened around it that looked like armour and all of the people with industrial style looking bows and arrows drawn on the pig, the arrows released, the pig either died or vanished, I think there was an explosion, and I think a bunch of scientists died too, and the remaining ones went over to the guy in the chair and were like, “what just happened?” and he said, “I never said that I would die, just that someone would” so I guess</p>
        <p>Wait Okay here’s my theory about the plot of the dream. Some accident happened that made the guy have increased brain power in the Lucy or Understand by Ted Chiang kind of way and he was dangerous because of it, so he kind of went around the country trying to like figure all that out and do stuff except he was being reckless and damaging so the scientists took him and kept him in an institution and one of his abilities was giving prophecies so he gave his prophecy about the pig and then they prepared for it thinking that the pig would kill him and have a lot of power and ruin the world but then the pig just went poof! When it actually came down to it so they were like dude wtf (but in a scared way) and he said the very creepy thing in response and sounded very villainous</p>
