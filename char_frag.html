<div id="zoologist_cow" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">cow</h2>
    <h3 class="author">zoologist</h3>
    <p>for some reason i have a memory of visiting relatives in france and using apple scented shampoo. i'm not sure if this really happened -- on the other hand, i don't know why i would imagine that out of nowhere, so i think it did. real or not, at its open, <i>cow</i> evokes cleanliness, the feeling of staring at unfamiliar tiles while you shower, something a little strange (in the étranger sense, not bizarre).</p>

    <p>
    then it mellows, and to me, becomes a skin scent. i think beyond the apple and sage in the top notes, i don't discern specific notes. just the pleasantness and again, cleanliness, of the florals. i do still think soapy. it's not overpowering though, which i'm very happy with. and although i always think of the half-memory of washing my hair with french sunlight streaming in, six hours from home, i also imagine boundless fields of long grass, waving in the wind.

    <h2 class="title">tonka blanc</h2>
    <h3 class="author">l'artisan parfumeur</h3>
    <p>i am so incredibly in love with <i>tonka blanc</i>. i was between getting a sample of this and l'artisan parfumeur's <i>iris de gris</i>, which has a note of peas, but i could imagine myself wearing <i>tonka blanc</i> much easier. i wasn't going to get either at all; thinking of my budget, i was going to cap myself at two samples but after having a really lovely chat, the woman at the perfume boutique kindly said if i wanted a third, they were all on her.</p>

    <p>the reason she even showed me and my best friend these two fragrances was that i mentioned how i love vegetal smells, fresh smells, herbal things. i always joke my ideal perfume is a salad (and she did bring out one that smells <i>exactly</i> like a salad with dressing). well, <i>tonka blanc</i> has a cauliflower note, but is mostly vanilla-y, citrus-y, and warm. holding open my little sample and inhaling is when i get most cauliflower, or immediately after application. i do wish i could smell it again sprayed rather than applied directly to my skin, to smell if the cauliflower is more apparent. but i seriously would eat this perfume if i could -- i feel like often i shy away from gourmands, just for fear of how strong and eventually nauseating they are to me, but this i'd eat and wear 24/7. fresh and warm, which is what i'm always aiming for.</p>

    <h2 class="title">rose saltifolia</h2>
    <h3 class="author">maison crivelli</h3>
    <p>i've been on the hunt for salty perfumes after getting a sample of <i>sel marin</i> by heeley last september. at the perfume boutique (wow, i really spent a lot of time at the perfume boutique), i said this, and the manager brought out <i>rose saltifolia</i>. i <i>adored</i> it. i think a lot of people -- dare i say most people -- who want a floral want one that's not too sweet, and i would recommend this. with the salty notes, you're taken outside, into fresh air and wind, but the rose reminds me exactly of those small, hard, rose-flavoured candies that always come in some cheesy on-theme tin. i've spent a lot of time rolling those candies around between my tongue and teeth. and this is an enormous reach, but pretty much any sweet-ish and bright fragrance reminds me of what my mom wears: <i>un jardin sur le nil</i> by hermès. approximately no one on this planet but me would smell a similarity, but between that and the rose candy and the salt and seaweed, i'm transported to my childhood.</p>

    <h2 class="title">from the garden</h2>
    <h3 class="author">maison margiela</h3>
    <p>more than any other accord, tomato leaf evokes delight in me. i think it goes back to visiting my paternal grandmother in france, although i can't seem to paste together a proper memory of her, me, and it. i want to say that the moment i connected tomatoes and this beautiful, green scent was around her plants, but i don't even know if she had any. nevertheless, whenever i'm near a tomato plant, i hungrily rub a leaf between my fingers and bring it to my nose to smell and i think of her. genuinely a top ten experience every time.</p>
    <p>me and tomatoes have a long history, which is actually just a short history: i didn't like them, i thought they were acidic and thus disgusting, the texture was offensive, and all of this was heightened by the fact that my sister <i>loved</i> them; this is a miniscule detail that has no bearing on absolutely anything except for the fact that we're sisters and so everywhere is inevitably a place for comparison.</p>
    <p>like most picky eaters, for a long time i refused to consider tomatoes with something other than disgust. they were just pushed to the side or not included on my plate or, if i really had to, they were chewed and swallowed with a large amount of water. by the time i had connected Beautiful Green Scent with Tomato, i was a little better with them; at a certain point food aversions become embarrassing rather than totally justified in your head. but that connection was a turning point: if this was what a tomato plant smelled like, i <i>had</i> to like tomatoes. and so... i started liking tomatoes. (i still can't get behind cherry tomatoes entirely. the texture makes me want to gag.)</p>
    <p>anyway, this is all to say that i have this weird emotional connection to the tomato leaf accord, and thus i am quite vocal about my love for it, and i obtained a bottle of <i>from the garden</i> as a result.</p>

  <div id="eris_deltaofvenus" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">delta of venus</h2>
    <h3 class="author">eris parfums</h3>
    <p>i initially learned of eris via <i>green spell</i>, which seemed super up my alley -- fragrantica lists tomato leaf, fig leaf, black currant, and mandarin orange amongst the notes -- but when i smelled it in store it didn't speak to me. instead, i got a sample of <i>delta of venus</i>, named for anaïs nin's collection of erotic stories, with notes of bergamot, grapefruit, jasmine, guava, sandalwood. and some others. but <i>wow</i>, doesn't that sound seductive?</p>
    <p>it's a tad sweet for me, not as sensual as it is overripe. i don't get sandalwood, but the fruits linger. of the two green-fruity-woody perfume samples i got with erotic names (this, and eros fig from libertine fragrance), i'm more drawn to eros fig.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="libertine_erosfig" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">eros fig</h2>
    <h3 class="author">libertine fragrance</h3>
    <p>fig as a note is a lot to me. i love it, but i always feel like it's going to eat me, like <i>i'm</i> the ripe one. my friend who got me interested in fragrances in the first place is a fig fan as well, so going through her collection was how i learned the scent. this is to say it's a social note, if one exists; i remember the lining my palm against the fig tree at the house my extended family stayed at some summers ago in france; sitting with my friend on the summer solstice with her basket of perfumes next to our beers; always as well hearing this line from a <a href="https://poets.org/poem/you-cant-have-it-all">poem</a> by barbara ras called "You Can't Have It All":
      <blockquote>But you can have the fig tree and its fat leaves like clown hands gloved with green.</blockquote>
      which i only remember because of that one line. and then there's the whole thing of figs being the sexiest fruit (bananas, papayas, strawberries be damned). or the most sensual.
    </p>
    <p>i think <i>eros fig</i> captures this well: the woodiness sweetly balances the fruit, somewhat evocative of incense, a dark room, a feast you might have in it, the conversations you might have there. would love a full size of this.</p>

  <div id="jorum_elegy" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">elegy</h2>
    <h3 class="author">jorum studio</h3>
    <p>i always affectionately think of <i>elegy</i> as smelling like a church, not that i've been in any a lot (and when i layer it with <i>eros fig</i>, i call it sex in a church). i think it's because of how powdery and intense it is. it's clean, citrus-y, grandma-y, flowery, dry. i can't tell if i like it more for summer or winter, but it seems suited for weather extremes. the bergamot is the most earl-grey-tea bergamot i've smelled in a perfume, which is maybe why i love it so much. kind of need a full size of this.</p>

  <div id="nishane_b612" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">b-612</h2>
    <h3 class="author">nishane</h3>
    <p>i got a sample of this after i asked the sales assistant at the perfume boutique if he had anything with a black pepper note. he explained that it doesn't actually have a black pepper note, but it's so spicy that it feels like it does. such are the effects of geranium and oakmoss...</p>
    <p>nice, and the nishane website says it's "aromatic / balsamic / fougère" which i can't really argue with. i feel like a fancy man when i wear it. part of me wants to say it's christmas-y, a balance between the cookies by the fireplace and the coniferous trees in the snow. where does that come from? vibes only, no notes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="nishane_wulongcha" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">wūlóng chá</h2>
    <h3 class="author">nishane</h3>
    <p>good, sweet, musky citrus. citrus that doesn't kill me with its citrus (the greatest danger of citrus). i think i would like it as a cocktail, with a candied lemon peel. <i>wūlóng chá</i> doesn't stand out to me very much, but it is comforting in how it reminds me of shanghai tang's <i>ginger flower</i> home fragrance. which bears no resemblance in notes except for tea-ish notes and musk. what it is i think is that for both the musk seems to propel the sweetness forward.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="memo_sintra" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">sintra</h2>
    <h3 class="author">memo paris</h3>
    <p>thissss motherfucking bitchhhh. no orange blossom has ever smelled better. every time i talk about <i>sintra</i> i <i>have</i> to say that i want to eat it and drink it and get an iv of it. best gourmand ever to me. pure candy, but a candy of dreams. as in, if a candy like this exists, i need to buy it immediately because there's no way that it does. read this:
    <blockquote>top: bergamot essence, red fruits accord, petit grain essence</blockquote>
    <blockquote>heart: orange blossom absolute, cinnamon bark essence, rose absolute</blockquote>
    <blockquote>base: vanilla bourbon extract, caramel accord, guimauve (marshmallow) musk</blockquote>
    motherfucker!!!!!! and it sounds like exactly the kind of thing that would be so sweet as to make me feel sick but it doesn't! thus the only thing between me and my lover is 235 euros...</p>

    <h2 class="title">sel marin</h2>
    <h3 class="author">heeley</h3>
    <p>i reallllyyyyy love <i>sel marin</i>. the word salty makes people hesitant, i think, or i know, from the number of times i've tried to get people to smell this. i'm clearly shooting myself in the foot, fuck. but listen to this (from the heeley website):
    <blockquote>top: lemon, italian bergamot</blockquote>
    <blockquote>heart: sea salt, moss, algae</blockquote>
    <blockquote>base: vetiver, cedar, musk</blockquote>
    doesn't that sound intriguing? like the perfect seaside stroll? and it actually is wonderfully aquatic and salty and refreshing. it's sent me on a hunt for more salty perfumes, and aquatic perfumes, which are not things i ever would have looked for without this one. i would love a bottle of this to wear all summer long.</p>

    <h2 class="title">basilico and fellini</h2>
    <h3 class="author">vilhelm parfumerie</h3>
    <p>like the platonic ideal of a fragrance, to me. maybe the charlottic ideal? green, herbal, fruity, summery. BASIL!!! edible for <i>sure</i>. fig is there, so it's sensual too. great. lucky us. we can roll around in the hay with our lovers this summer and go for a caprese salad and taste it when we kiss after. but truly, the first fragrance that made it click for me that you can smell like a memory or a concept. it's almost too good to wear. what business does vilhelm parfumerie have bottling up the perfect summer romance?</p>

  <div id="lush_pansy" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">pansy</h2>
    <h3 class="author">lush</h3>
    <p><i>pansy</i> is my sweetie pie lover dear. my best girl. my darling fille. <i>pansy</i> was the first perfume i got, after my horrible first year of university where i kept to myself, failed two classes, stayed in bed for days, called my mom crying pretty much every week, and overall was miserable. it was my treat to myself for having to stay in [UNIVERSITY CITY] a month longer, to take a class i couldn't during the school year because i failed its prequisite. and there were a whole lot of things that led to me enjoying my first class of my university career, not just this perfume, but i feel attached to it as a talisman.</p>
    <p>
    it's very intensely floral: fragrantica lists orange blossom and rosemary on top, blackberry, "floral notes", and bergamot in the middle, and galbanum and labdanum as the base. "floral notes", unspecific, strikes me as sweetly juvenile, like a kid thrusting a bouquet of flowers towards you. i also couldn't discern specific flowers; i'm not the best at picking apart a fragrance, even after a few years of taking every chance i can to sniff around sephora. i also still have no idea what galbanum and labdanum smell like on their own. i guess those are the grounding, musky accords to balance out that absolute garden?</p>
    <p>i still am taken back to calc 2 and my daily routine of doing integrals, integrals, and more integrals, and then binge-watching rupaul's drag race and downing litres of coconut water. <i>pansy</i> is so linked to that period of late spring / early summer, solo reading in the park, and 8:30am math, that sometimes i'm afraid to spray it, for fear of regressing to my 18.5 year old self who had only just stopped feeling like the world was over. and i'm still that dramatic, clearly.</p>
    <p>it also just smells really good. good for the budget, good for the nose, very spring and summer friendly, very charlotte, i even have a blackberry tattoo -- unrelated to this, but i get even more sentimental about <i>pansy</i> when i think about it.</p>
