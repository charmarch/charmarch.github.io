<div id="agua_viva" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">água viva</h2>
    <h3 class="author">clarice lispector</h3>
    <p>clarice lispector is hard to follow if you like a strict logic in your books. i have a mental list of my friends to whom i would recommend her work -- they happen to be the more delusional ones (said with affection, because me too) -- and those to whom i would recommend it, and then say, "i don't think you'll like it, though".</p>
    <p>i started last summer with <i>an apprenticeship or the book of pleasures</i>, adored it, felt like it was divine intervention that i read it when i read it, and have only now gotten to another book of hers. this is in part due to me, for some reason, having my sights set on reading <i>água viva</i> in particular, and then having difficulty locating it. there ended up being one copy left in the fancy, curated bookstore near me, which i snagged, which i did not read for several months. it's summer now, though, so i've been taking it to the backyard and lying in the sun with it (also how i read <i>an apprenticeship</i>).</p>
    <p>it's like an enchanting slog. this is a bit unflattering to it, sorry lispector, but it's a meditation on writing, on capturing <i>instants</i> (which take longer than an instant to capture and in turn, read), on some elusive human essence that arises from writing, between the words. so a lot of things, and lispector gets at them from many angles -- a lot of mentions of eating placenta -- and enters and recedes from moments of seeming comprehension. she talks about the sea a bit, and watching the foam, and i'm also thinking of the climactic scene in <i>an apprenticeship</i> where the narrator lóri goes into the ocean at dawn and metamorphoses -- all to say that that's what <i>água viva</i> feels like, a series of sometimes calm, sometimes frenzied waves meeting the sand.</p>

    <p>on another note, i enjoy perfumes and talking about perfumes (pun intended!!). in this aspect i feel close to lispector, since she does also. about halfway through she says <blockquote>What am I doing in writing to you? trying to photograph perfume.</blockquote> which takes me back to how i wouldn't strongly recommend this to, say, someone who needs a plot to keep them interested. i don't think they would much appreciate the couple pages where she lists flowers and their characteristic scents:
    <blockquote>Jasmine is for lovers. It makes you want to put an ellipsis now. They walk holding hands, swinging their arms and giving each other gentle kisses to the fragrant almost-sound of jasmine.</blockquote>
    i've been reading that passage over for a day now. what lispector and the translator, stefan tobler, create is expressive and mystical. i don't think i've read a better representation of thinking and feeling.

    <h2 class="title">inseparable</h2>
    <h3 class="author">simone de beauvoir</h3>
    <p>i remember last summer looking for books about intense friendships. it's an addictive sort of theme; it's a validation of your own bewildering depth of emotions and a chance to remember them, when they happened so long ago. so i read <i>dogs of summer</i> by andrea abreu -- not really my thing, although the timing was apt, to have read it in the dog days. and in the winter before i read <i>sweet days of discipline</i> by fleur jaeggy, another read timed appropriately, for how frigid the writing and characters were.</p>
    <p><i>inseparable</i> is quite short. the audiobook is 3.5 hours, or about three or four walks around my neighbourhood. i never <i>get</i> the book quite as well in audio format -- it's easy for my mind to wander and for me to have to rewind. but i liked this one (except for the narrator's pronunciation of maman and papa as ma-maaaw and pa-paaaw which made me feel like i was going crazy). it's about the friendship of andrée and sylvie from the latter's point of view, as young girls and then as young women. they differ in matters of faith, as well as the social circles they (mostly andrée) are constricted by.</p>
    <p>quote i like:
        <blockquote>One night, sleeping in a damp field, looking up at the moon, I said to myself there are sins! And yet I was firmly resolved to continue to eat, read, talk and dream exactly as I pleased.</blockquote>
    that's about sylvie gradually realizing she doesn't believe in God. yippeeeee. and she grows up and goes to school to enter the workforce because her father can't afford a dowry, but andrée is in the position of wanting to work but being unable to because of what her family wants (to find her a good husband as soon as her older sister finds a good husband). but then it's this whole thing because andrée is in love with this guy named pascal who is perfectly religious for her needs. and there's a sad ending, but really the whole thing is about religion and what God wants and how opaque it is. well it's about friendship and devotion and how foundational it is. well it's about education and marriage and how restrictive the latter is. well it's about

<div id="symmetry_and_the_monster" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">symmetry and the monster</h2>
    <h3 class="author">mark ronan</h3>
    <p>this has been on my reading list since autumn of second year, when a TA for algebra 1 mentioned it. group theory was the sweetest topic that semester to me -- i liked that way of thinking, i really liked symmetry groups, and i got attached to the topic the way you do when you have hours and hours of homework for it every week.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    the interweaving of math and history in <i>symmetry and the monster</i> is pretty good, although sometimes jarring. some of the historical tidbits included seem random, such as in the paragraph about lie and klein's visit to paris in 1870. ronan explains that it was cut short by war with prussia breaking out, and that "as winter set in, animals from the zoo were auctioned off for meat". okay???? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    although it's more of pop science book, with how it's gentle (as in nonrigorous) and introductory, i feel that if i didn't come in knowing some basics i would be very lost. i think, for definitions or explanations, ronan lingers on the obvious and sweeps over the nonintuitive. that being said, i suppose people don't have the same intuition; maybe what i find wildly confusing comes naturally to someone who has spurned mathematics. i recommended it to my dad, so if he gets around to it i'll see what he has to say, because i'm pretty sure he doesn't know what a group is. i also recommended it to someone who <i>does</i> know what groups are, which i know because on our first date he mentioned his research class having to do with rotations, and i said, "group theory? that's so hot". jesus christ charlotte

<div id="gut_symmetries" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">gut symmetries</h2>
    <h3 class="author">jeanette winterson</h3>
    <p>last year, after i finished <i>bluets</i> by maggie nelson, an online friend recommended strongly <i>written on the body</i> by jeanette winterson to me. i noted that down for later, and then later came, and i didn't feel like reading anything. i didn't care about fiction or nonfiction, i didn't want to be introduced to characters or facts that i would have to make room in my brain for.</p>

    <p>winter semester came, which is my enemy. i slept. i went on my phone. i did my schoolwork with great reluctance. i did not read.</p>

    <p>then i had a hell schedule of exams and a budding spring romance -- i survived the first and have been trying to sustain the second -- and finally made it out into the real world (the bookstore) with my sister. i've browsed the jeannette winterson titles in this bookstore before, considered this one, put it back, but this time i decided to purchase it. the sciencey synopsis appealed to me. also the idea of a love triangle.</p>

    <p><i>gut symmetries</i> didn't end up being much of either, to me. i think my issue (not with the book, but as a reader) is that when i want science i want it difficult and real. i want a textbook, with emotional annotations. in first year, when i was taking linear algebra, i couldn't let go of the idea of using vectors to represent how digital or epistolary communication is a flattening: a projection onto a plane. it was a very literal, bijective metaphor, and that's what i was craving with this book. there's some of that, but it gets drowned beneath the prose. felt like having to wade through data to uncover significant results. i keep feeling like i should do a disclaimer: for literate people who enjoy literary fiction and the like, this is probably excellent. i've been feeling quite illiterate lately and would enjoy reading a function defined f(alice, who is the main narrator) = f(stella, the wife of jove) = f(jove, who alice is having an affair with). actually i think f(a) = f(s) != f(j). not sure. doing silly made up math reminded me of this part where alice (i think) is saying that her and stella and jove didn't add up or multiply or something like that; you don't get 1 + 2 = 3, or maybe it was something else. it was her meditating on the fact that their combination mathematically/practically was unexpected. girl that's a permutation. a combination even. it was literally her being like 3 choose 2. i just wanted to be like ok well you just need to choose the right equation. cuz i'm annoying</p>

    <p>more concisely, here are my notes after i finished:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>shallowly suited to me: science metaphors, tarot cards, love triangle</li>
        <li>not dense writing but intricate for my taste. indirect and obfuscated. prose was nice but not that nice to me</li>
        <li>lots of water. formless, can be shaped, can drown in, need to live, boats for life?</li>
        <li>why so much on the character's birth stories? for the women at least. a little bit mythical. and i don't mind the mythical (why read fiction if you mind the mythical) but i actually kind of minded because it bored me a bit</li>
        <li>eating flesh. as always. i liked this part</li>
        <li>alice pov at the end where she describes her emotions and how they are guards against lovers i really loved that a lot</li>
    </ul>

    <p>one last thing: i sent a pic of a page (it had quotes from einstein and oppenheimer, obviously chosen and placed to be thinly veiled comments on alice's viewpoint and emotional state) to the boy of the aforementioned spring romance (also mentioned in my review of symmetry and the monster), and asked him what he thought of science metaphors for human connection and such. he said (paraphrased), "yeah sure, as long people understand the actual meaning", which i'm inclined to disagree with a little, because i think you don't need to understand quantum physics to understand that a person is both a particle and a wave, but then i don't think either of us are talking about the same thing.</p>

<div id="she_comes_first" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">she comes first</h2>
    <h3 class="author">ian kerner, PhD</h3>
    <p>one night on instagram dms, my best friend sent me a video of herself talking about a book that she was reading as a research project, in a way. <i>she comes first</i> is a book written by a man, primarily for men, about giving head to women. as she is a girl in a relationship with a girl, she was curious about the perspective and how much of it she would already be familiar with. i think her review partway through was something like "i was surprised how much of what is intuitive to me was written out explicitly, but there were a few things i learned". since i need to know what's going on in her mind 24/7 (she's like my own personal influencer) i decided to also borrow it from the library.</p>
    <p>what ensued was 48 hours of me spamming her texts with various screenshots of the book with commentary. some highlights were:
        <ul>
            <li>ian kerner's brief list of vulva-wine pairings</li>
            <li>ian kerner's warning that blowing <i>up there</i> may result in an embolism which may result in death, immediately followed by p***y-eating affirmations (he calls them the Three Assurances)</li>
            <li>the chapter title "Think Outside Her Box"</li>
            <li>ian kerner's extensive list of erotica he recommends to read with your partner which includes <i>delta of venus</i> by anaïs nin which is a book i would not read with another soul if my life depended on it</li>
            <li>A LOLITA QUOTE.</li>
            <li>the ending line being "When she comes first, she comes forever."</li>
        </ul>
    needless to say, this book incited a lot of emotions in me such as fear, anxiety, delight, amusement, and shock (vulva-wine pairings is crazyyyy). i think i talked about it to like six people just to bring up the wine pairings. none of them seemed that keen to read it after that, but honestly it was an informative and fun read. and i'm not really in the position of needing or wanting to <i>study</i> it, so it was a one and done ordeal for me.
    </p>
    <p>was it <i>really</i> a one and done ordeal for me, though? it spiked so much anxiety in me that i decided i needed to read a book about female sexuality from a female perspective. not so much as a palate cleanser, but as an assurance. not that <i>she comes first</i> was <i>wrong</i>, but that i got so weird about it all being super goal-oriented even with its occasional disclaimer that it should be pleasure-oriented that i was like telling my best friend "oh my god i need an affirmation". so thank you, ian kerner, for inspiring my summer of books about sexuality and the body. 
    </p>
    <p>a final note: what my best friend was saying about what was intuitive to her being written out explicitly, i agree with. kerner very clearly describes the process of female arousal, how long it typically takes, et cetera, that <i>she comes first</i> was an unspoken lesson on male arousal as an inverse.</p>

<div id="come_as_you_are" class="review">
    <h2 class="title">come as you are</h2>
    <h3 class="author">emily nagoski</h3>
    <p>i heard about <i>come as you are</i> by emily nagoski several years ago from a youtube video by hannah witton, a sex educator. this was where i first encountered the framework nagoski introduces in <i>come as you are</i>, that of sexual inhibitors and accelerators and the importance of context to (especially female) sexuality. a little while later, i watched a video featuring nagoski herself explaining this, which stuck it in my brain a bit better, although i never really thought about it again until i was reading <i>she comes first</i> by ian kerner and somewhat frantically decided i needed to read a book about female sexuality from a female author.</p>
    <p><i>come as you are</i> is fine. it's great, actually, i just think that i'm not the bull's-eye-of-the-target audience, that is, people who want/need to hear affirmation after affirmation about how beautiful and normal they are. it was definitely nice to hear, but the constant reiteration became grating. and there were so many metaphors about how to think of your sexuality and body and i am just really not a person who needs to consider any part of me as a garden so that was a little troublesome. i guess i'm fortunate enough that society hasn't knocked my (apparently large) ego down that many pegs?</p>
    <p>i'm only half serious about that, though, since i am still in the target audience (just maybe not bull's eye). i did actually learn a lot about spontaneous vs. responsive desire, arousal, how to enable it, a billion other things that all started to blend together until the only thing i retained was, "everyone is different. everyone is normal. you can change the context." i would recommend this book to all my female friends, or at least the worksheets included at the end of sections. maybe check out the tl;dr's at the end of the sections instead. because i did get quite bored even while learning things.</p>
    <p>bonus text i sent my best friend when i was done:
        <blockquote>Tediously repetitive about how beautiful and normal everyone is but I recognize that a lot of people really do need to hear that bc they don’t already have an ego the size of the moon. I could do without all the garden metaphors and the like. I do think it’s a valuable read because of how much it tries to dismantle common notions of women’s sexuality and what it should be, including those that are puritanical and consider it like sinful but also those that are “modern” and idealize needlessly porn-like sex.</blockquote>
   which reminds me of another thing i liked about it: nagoski weaves stories from women with various common experiences of sexuality throughout, and using the beloved framework, leads them to happy endings. she explains at the beginning that these women are not real individuals, but meshes of women with overlapping experiences, which i thought was super great and useful to see how what she teaches could be applied practically.</p>
